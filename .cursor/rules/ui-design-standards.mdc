# UI Design Standards

## Design Philosophy
- **Modern & Clean**: Prioritize minimalist, contemporary design
- **User-Centric**: Focus on excellent user experience and intuitive interfaces
- **Responsive**: Ensure compatibility across devices and screen sizes

## Supported Design Systems
- **Material Design**: Google's design language with elevation, shadows, and motion
- **Minimalist/Modern**: Clean lines, ample whitespace, subtle interactions
- **Dark Mode**: Support dark theme variants for better accessibility
- **Card-Based Layouts**: Organize content in digestible card components
- **Neumorphism**: Soft, extruded surfaces with subtle shadows and highlights

## Color & Typography
- Use consistent color palettes with proper contrast ratios
- Implement semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, success, error, warning)
- Choose readable typography with appropriate font weights and sizes
- Support system font preferences when possible

## Internationalization
- **Bilingual Support**: Implement Chinese (中文) and English language options
- Use proper i18n libraries (react-i18next, next-i18next, etc.)
- Consider text expansion/contraction in UI layouts
- Implement RTL support considerations for future expansion

## Component Standards
- Build reusable, composable components
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
- Include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Provide visual feedback for user interactions

## Animation & Interactions
- Use subtle, purposeful animations
- Implement smooth transitions between states
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Consider reduced motion preferences for accessibility
